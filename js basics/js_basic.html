        <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
          JavaScriptis extremly popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small
          and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers
          to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside
          a host enviroment (a web browser or node server), it can be connected
          to the objects of these enviroments to provide programic control over
          them.

          <li>
            <a href="#">Variable Declaration</a>JavaScript variable are
            containers for storing data values-imagine a cup you full with
            coffee, the cup holds the coffee a variable holds a value. All
            JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These
            unique names are called identifiers. <mark>Var x</mark>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <a href="#">Variable Adjustment</a>Assignment operators assign
            values to JavaScript variables- Our cup can now have coffee poured
            in it, giving our variable a value to hold, The= assignment operator
            assigns a value to a variable. <mark>var x=10;</mark>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <a href="#">Data Type</a>Data types are an important concept; to be
            able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There
            are six data types that are JavaScript primitive: Boolean
            -<mark>true</mark>or <mark>false;</mark> null -
            <mark>null</mark> aka nothing; number- <mark>42</mark> or
            <mark> 3.14159</mark> string-
            <mark>.”coding dojo rocks!”;</mark> array-
            <mark>[1,’coding’,2,’dojo’];</mark> and object-<mark
              >{first_name:’jane’,last_name:’doe’}</mark
            >
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <a href="#">Conditionals</a>When you write code, you want to perform
            different actions for different decisions- hitting -different code
            blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use
            conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are
            the following conditional statements: <mark>if</mark> a specified
            condition is true, do this code in our code block;<mark
              >else if</mark
            >
            to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is
            false;<mark>else</mark> we execute this block of code;
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <a href="#">Loops</a>There are many different kinds of loops in
            every programming language, but they all essentially do the same
            thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you
            have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and
            then you stop. That’s a loop!
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <a href="#">Functions</a>Functions are an encapsulation of a code
            block. When we call our function this will run that code block.
            Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are
            putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual
            and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we
            place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our
            instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call
            our function over and over and over again.
